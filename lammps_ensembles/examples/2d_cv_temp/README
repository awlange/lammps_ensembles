This example illustrates how to perform a 2 dimensionsal replica exchange
parallel tempering/umbrella sampling calculation. The collective variable 
(CV) is just a distance between two atoms of different sidechains of the peptide. 

o  There are 16 replicas, each with a different set temperature and 
   CV combination:
   id  temp    CV equil
   0   275.0   15.0
   1   285.0   15.0
   2   295.0   15.0
   3   305.0   15.0
   4   275.0   15.1
   5   285.0   15.1
   6   295.0   15.1
   7   305.0   15.1
   8   275.0   15.2
   9   285.0   15.2
   10  295.0   15.2
   11  305.0   15.2
   12  275.0   15.3
   13  285.0   15.3
   14  295.0   15.3
   15  305.0   15.3

o  The topology of the replica neighbors is a square, 4 temperatures
   by 4 CVS. Both dimensions are non-circular. The neighboring looks
   like this (arrow points in positive direction):

   temperature--> 
   12  13  14  15   ^
    8   9  10  11   |
    4   5   6   7   |
    0   1   2   3   CV

o  There is a separate input for each replica, files in.peptide.*
   Each input contains the COORDX, REPLICA, DIMENSION, and NEIGHBORS
   headers to define the run settings.

o  The file ens_input.dat contains a listing of the replica indexes,
   the input files for each replica, and how many MPI ranks to use. 

o  The data.peptide.* files define the force field types, etc. and
   the starting geometry. All replicas begin with the same geometry
   in this example (because I am lazy).

o  CAUTION: The out.*.colvars.traj files will contain repeated lines  
   due to swapping. In post-processing, just be aware of that!

o  To run this example, use the following (noting that you may need
   to specify the full path of ens_driver depending on your $path):
   
   mpiexec -np 16 ens_driver 16 -log -readinput ens_input.dat
