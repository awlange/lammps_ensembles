This example illustrates how to perform a 2 dimensionsal replica exchange
umbrella sampling calculation. Both collective variables (CVs) 
are a distance between two atoms in the peptide. 

o  There are 16 replicas, each with its own CV equilibria defined in 
   the files peptide.colvars.* 

o  There is a separate input for each replica, files in.peptide.*
   Each input contains the COORDX, REPLICA, DIMENSION, and NEIGHBORS
   headers to define the run settings.

o  All replicas run at 275.0 Kelvin.

o  The file ens_input.dat contains a listing of the replica indexes,
   the input files for each replica, and how many MPI ranks to use. 

o  The data.peptide.* files define the force field types, etc. and
   the starting geometry. All replicas begin with the same geometry
   in this example (because I am lazy).

o  CAUTION: The out.*.colvars.traj files will contain repeated lines  
   due to swapping. In post-processing, just be aware of that!
   
o  To run this example, use the following (noting that you may need
   to specify the full path of ens_driver depending on your $path):
   
   mpiexec -np 16 ens_driver 16 -log -readinput ens_input.dat
