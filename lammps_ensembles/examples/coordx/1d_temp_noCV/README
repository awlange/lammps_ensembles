This example illustrates how to perform a 1 dimensionsal replica exchange
parallel tempering calculation without umbrella sampling. 

o  There are 4 replicas, each with a different temperature. 

o  There is a separate input for each replica, files in.peptide.*
   Each input contains the COORDX, REPLICA, DIMENSION, and NEIGHBORS
   headers to define the run settings.

o  Setting "fix none" in the COORDX tag tells the driver to ignore
   colvars fix.

o  The file ens_input.dat contains a listing of the replica indexes,
   the input files for each replica, and how many MPI ranks to use. 

o  The data.peptide.* files define the force field types, etc. and
   the starting geometry. All replicas begin with the same geometry
   in this example (because I am lazy).

o  To run this example, use the following (noting that you may need
   to specify the full path of ens_driver depending on your $path):
   
   mpiexec -np 4 ens_driver 4 -log -readinput ens_input.dat
