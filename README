LAMMPS Ensembles (LE) is a multidimensional replica exchange interface to LAMMPS.

LE creates multiple instances of LAMMPS classes on a set of MPI subcommunicators.
Each subcom starts up its own LAMMPS instance and runs molecular dynamics. 
After so many MD steps, exchanges are attempted between replicas according to
Boltzmann statistics probability (Metropolis criteria).

LE can run: 
   o  Parallel tempering replica exchange in one dimension

   o  Hamiltonian exchange in one dimension

   o  Replica exchange umbrella sampling in an arbitrary number of dimensions,
      each dimension having a different collective variable. REUS is run
      via the colvars library that ships with LAMMPS.

   o  REUS + parallel tempering in one dimension

   o  REUS + Hamiltonian exchange in one dimension

   o  Dimensions which are linear or circular, thereby supporting many
      possible topologies (e.g. 3-D torus).
